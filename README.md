# oauth-proxy-rs

A minimalists implementation of an oauth-proxy (like [oauth2-proxy](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy) or similar) in rust with very little overhead.

Apart from that there are no real selling points, in most cases you probably want to use one of the existing solutions instead.
